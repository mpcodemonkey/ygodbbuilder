<p>This project was meant as an attribute parser for Yu-Gi-Oh cards from both the Yu-Gi-Oh wikia and Konami's official search site. The parser for the official site is fairly straightforward: each database entry has a specific set of tags that only differ among card types, and therefore parsing these entries and building a database is quite trivial.</p>

<p>Parsing the wikia however, proved to be an immense undertaking. There is some basic standardization between wiki pages, but getting both card attributes and card images proved to be fairly difficult. This is coupled with the fact that even among cards in the same set, the page format was different, and tags differed between the same card attributes on different pages. On top of that, at the time of development, the site API was going through some significant changes and upgrades, which made it impossible to use the simple API calls to make an XML parser.</p>

<p>This project is no longer actively developed. Feel free to reuse/refactor whatever you would like from it. I did it as a proof of concept for another project that died out long ago, and therefore I do not have an interest in maintaining it.</p>
